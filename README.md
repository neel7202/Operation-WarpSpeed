# Operation-WarpSpeed

For our final project in QTM 151 we decided to emulate the national plan called operation warp speed which aimed to most effectively distribute vaccines to the US population. Similarly, our project here aims to understand which demographics, regions, and states are most being effected by covid-19 which would give us a better understanding of how the vaccines should be distributed. Data from the CDC was used. I myself was in charge of the data cleaning to group states by region as well as the gender, ethinicity, and age graphs that were grouped by region.
